Strengths & Skills

Interdisciplinary work
I thrive and I feel right at home in culturally diverse teams and interdisciplinary environments. I enjoy how they constantly require me to quickly learn new things, challenge my assumptions, and keep an open mind.

Capable generalist
Throw anything at me and I will likely get it done. I love solving problems and using my brain just as much as I enjoy organizing events and building things.
On top of that, I have a talent for design and anything visual.
